# This is already basically a wavetable, you just need to interpolate.

## 29/12/23 17:28 -> revert example to fixed phase increment, add frequency variable to paTestData struct

Todo: 

- Implement frequency
- Implement stereo detune

_________
# Then make another and do some wave table blending
If you make other wavetables for commons shapes, you can blend between them using exactly the same weighting idea as you need to use to increment using float values


___
# Circular buffering

Adding to a buffer can't hurt as it'll give you the opportunity to add some simple delay effects for space. Potential for stereo delay amount as parameter


then look at midi maybe?

Waveshaping?
